## Introduction

This guide serves as a comprehensive README for managing a Git-based project from initialization to remote collaboration using branches and pull requests. It is structured for beginner and intermediate users working with both local and remote repositories.

---

## Project Setup

### Creating Directories and Files

```bash
mkdir project
cd project
touch name.txt
```

- Create and enter a project directory.
- Generate a text file for practice.

### Initializing Git

```bash
git init
```

- Initializes a new Git repository in the current folder.

## Working with Git

### Basic Commands

```bash
ls        # List files
ls -a     # Show all files including hidden (.git)
ls .git   # View Git's internal files
cat name.txt  # View file content
```

### Staging and Committing

```bash
git status           # Show changes

# Stage changes
  git add .          # Stage everything
  git add name.txt   # Stage specific file

# Commit staged changes
git commit -m "modified: name.txt"

# View commit history
git log
```

### Undoing and Restoring

```bash
git restore --staged name.txt   # Unstage a file
git reset <commit_hash>         # Reset to a specific commit
rm -rf name.txt                 # Force delete a file
```

### Working with Stash

```bash
git stash               # Save uncommitted changes temporarily
git stash pop           # Restore the latest stash
git stash list          # View stashed entries
git stash clear         # Delete all stashes (cannot recover)
```

> âœ… You do **not** need to stage files before using `git stash`. It saves all tracked file changes.

---

## Remote Repositories

### Adding Origin and Upstream

```bash
git remote add origin <your-remote-url>
git remote add upstream <upstream-remote-url>
```

- **Origin** is your personal fork.
- **Upstream** is the main/original repository.

> You can only push to `origin`. For contributing to the main project, create a pull request to `upstream`.

### Branching and HEAD

```bash
git branch            # List branches
git checkout -b feature-x   # Create and switch to new branch
```

- `HEAD` points to the current active branch.
- All new changes are made on the branch `HEAD` points to.

---

## Best Practices for Branches and Pull Requests

- ðŸ”´ **Do not commit directly on main/master**.
- âœ… Create a **new branch for each feature**.
- âœ… One branch = One pull request.
- âœ… Helps with reviewing, testing, and managing failures.

### Example Workflow

```bash
git checkout -b feature-login
# make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Added login functionality"
git push origin feature-login
```

Then go to GitHub and open a pull request from `feature-login` to `upstream/main`.

---

## Syncing Fork with Upstream

### Step-by-Step

```bash
git fetch --all --prune              # Clean and update all remotes

# Sync local main with upstream
  git checkout main
  git reset --hard upstream/main
  git pull upstream main             # Optional if reset not used
  git push origin main               # Push updates to your fork
```
